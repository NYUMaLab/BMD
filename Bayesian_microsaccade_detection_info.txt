Bayesian microsaccade detection info. PACKAGE IN PROGRESS.
1. Compile cpp code. 

g++  -std=c++11 -O3 -I$BOOST_INC  -fexpensive-optimizations -Wall -Wextra -o bmd bayesian_microsaccade_detection.cpp

2. Run BMD inference algorithm.

./bmd x1.txt C1.txt integral_table.txt params.txt changepoints.txt >output.txt

3. Analyze and plot the output. 

Run in Matlab BMD_results_analysis_and_visualization.m, which calls the helper function tau_to_C.m (to convert from change points tau to the eye state time series C). The script reads the samples containing the change points from the changepoints.txt files, converts the change points tau to the eye state time series C via the helper function tau_to_C.m and average across the samples to yield the probability of the eye being in a micro saccade state. The script produces a plot such as microsaccades_inferred_BMD.pdf.
